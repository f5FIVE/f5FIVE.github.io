        "f5_9":" ALLES is a decentralized blockchain infrastructure developed based on blockchain 3.0 architecture, which is a decentralized financial integrated ecosystem through global community users to build autonomy together. Relying on the powerful blockchain underlying application technology and rich product functions of the community, ALLES quickly completes cross-chain bridges, SWAP, stable coins, NFT, and financial derivatives related smart contracts in conjunction with FAR NFT ecology and HALO Network, allowing ALLES to truly realize the application value of decentralized financial integrated ecosystem.",
        "f5_10":"ALLES is constructed with blockchain technology, which has the characteristics of traceability, non-tamperability and high transparency, and realizes the decentralization of business system through smart contracts, with open source code and public unmanned controllability; the advantage of decentralization will be able to raise and trade capital at low price and fast, and realize the multiplication of profits. In the ALLES ecology, users will be able to realize NFT transactions, link DeFi applications, participate in stable coin transactions, participate in liquidity mining and other functions in a secure and compliant environment. As the consensus of ALLES grows, the AES will also grow with it.",
        "f5_11":"ALLES is committed to building a new generation of global institutional decentralized financial infrastructure, providing a complete decentralized financial infrastructure for enterprises and individuals. Based on the community governance of DAO, the concept of financial excellence, based on fair and secure distributed ledger and blockchain technology, to create a decentralized wallet, transaction, lending, prophecy, capital management and other DeFi + DAO + Web3.0 + NFT facilities as a whole, cross-chain financial services ecosystem.",
        "f5_12":"ALLES has designed four pivot strategies: contract pivot, revenue pivot, risk control pivot, and cross-chain pivot, using AES tokens to carry the function of ALLES community governance rights, and through the ecological financial equity credentials tToken throughout different ecological product applications, in an effort to provide users with a new world of globalized DeFi financial future with low participation threshold, convenient operation, stable revenue, open and fair, and open source security.",
        "f5_13":"1. Easy to operate",
        "f5_14":"Users only need to pledge tokens to gain access to the higher yielding liquidity mining revenue across the network.",

        "f5_18":"Users only need to bear the pledge and withdrawal of Gas fees, without spending huge time and effort to screen mining projects.",

        "f5_19":"4. Uncommon loss",
        "f5_20":"Users pledge single coins, and the platform matches funds to participate in liquidity mining, and sets up a unique risk hedging mechanism to resist impermanent losses, so users do not have to bear the impermanent losses from mining.",
        "f5_21":"5. High utilization rate of funds",
        "f5_22":"Because of the unique risk control mechanism, ALLES platform capital utilization rate will be close to 100%, striving to bring users a safe, stable and higher return.        ",

        "f5_29":"ALLES Mining is a Defi2.0 revenue aggregator with an innovative and unique economic model and business structure that provides more efficient, secure, stable, LP mining revenue. The goal is to make it easier for DeFi users participating in the ecosystem to mine and improve the LP liquidity solution of the project to allow users to earn higher returns. Users only need to deposit a certain amount of AES mining standard, USDT+BNB, into the contract to generate arithmetic power, and all proceeds will be rewarded to users in the form of AES. ALLES smart strategy will be through the smart contract and user participation in the mining arithmetic pledge of the gold standard to calculate the mining mineral output ratio calculation for mining, through the project itself to improve and unique business model of infinite deflation destruction and mining principle, then defined as mining destruction mechanism, so as to protect the platform coin AES infinite value-added.",
        "f5_30":"ALLES Earn Collection is an earnings aggregator that automatically selects the highest yield available, siphoning the value of each DeFi product with the goal of maximizing returns on holdings in a lossless manner.        ",
        "f5_31":"ALLES uses an automated market maker mechanism, or AMM, which you can think of as a primitive, robotic market maker that quotes two assets simultaneously based on a simple pricing algorithm where the number of units of each asset it holds is multiplied together and always equals a constant.        ",

        "f5_32":"The core value of DAO is de-neutralized autonomy, and the scope of application of this new form of organization formed by contract and smart contract is expanding, ALLES innovates with the times and proposes DEFI+DAO governance, financial distributed autonomous organization governance mechanism to create a new era of de-neutralized finance.In terms of technology, ALLES for the first time integrates smart contracts, prophecy machines, locking IP on the chain and other technologies, combined with the characteristics of the public chain, to create a new model that is completely different from the traditional, subverting the traditional.
